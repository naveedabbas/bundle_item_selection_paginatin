# Bundle item selections pagination
# Problem
1. Login to admin interface 
2. Create bundle product 
3. Create at least 31 simple products 
4. Edit previously created bundle product 
5. Create one bundle items option and add at least 21 products under it 
6. Make sure that your bundle option has pagination
7. Now there is no option to increase the number of items, so we can use the drag n drop feature to change the sort the order

# Solution
1. Install this simple extension
2. Run Mageno commands
3. Navigate to Stores->Configurations->NA
4. Change the pagination limit to whatever you want
